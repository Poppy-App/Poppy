## Overview
### Description
Poppy allows college students to skip the hassles associated with selling and buying old items such as clothes, furniture, etc. This platform organizes all the items that are for sale and makes it easy for a consumer to find a multitude of options for what they are searching for. Sellers and buyers can chat through Poppy directly and negotiate a sale. 


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** E-commerce
- **Mobile:** It is more convenient to take pictures on a phone and it is more natural to communicate
- **Story:** We are a team of 4 college students who noticed Facebook Marketplace and similar services are often disorganized and have cases of fraud. Additonally, those services aren't tailored directly to students!
- **Market:** College Students
- **Habit:** Students will use this app every time they need to sell their old items or if they are on the market to buy an inexpensive used item. 
- **Scope:** This app will be feasible to do within our allotted time frame because its features are not uniquely complex.
